###Useful ROOT command line commands###

-Making a piecewise TF1 function 
TF1 *f3 = new TF1("f3","(x<[3])*0+(x>=[3])*[0]*(exp(-(x-[3])/[1])-exp(-(x-[3])/[2]))",0,5000)
--use the piecewise definition in parenthesis and add two functions together. Can even be used with as a parameter.

-Pull an object from another file directory
TObj *name;
_file#->GetObject("Name in _file# directory",name);
--points object in currenty directory to object from another file directory.

-Plot TTree vector or array branch against the index number
TTree->Draw("vector:Iteration$>>h(maxIndex,0,maxIndex,ybins,ylow,yup)","","colz")
